<h3 id="보안--해킹">보안 &amp; 해킹</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Explain difference between asymmetric and symmetric crypto with some use cases (Answer) Encryption algorithms are either symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key to perform both the encryption and decryption processes. Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses two keys, a public key for encryption and a corresponding private key for decryption. The public key and private key are mathematically related so that when the public key is used for encryption, the corresponding private key must be used for decryption. AWS KMS uses only symmetric encryption.</p>

  <li>
    <p>What are reasons you would hash a file?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IPS/IDS: (Answer 1.) IDS - Intrusion Detection System - very much like a CCTV camera at the entrace. Is a passive system that scans incoming traffic. Once the IDS identifies dangerous/suspicious traffic, it sends alerts to IPS (Answer 2.) IPS - Intrusion Prevention System - actively blocks or prevent intrusions. Once unwelcomed packets are identified, IPS puts them in quarantine or drops them. (Answer 3.) IDS and IPS are not 2 different physical devices. Combined into next generation firewalls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is Federation?(Answer) Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encryption at rest/in transit (Answer) Password encrypted in DB / HTTPS or SSL</p>
  </li>
  <li>Asymmetric key encryption was introduced to complement the inherent problem of the need to share the same key in symmetrical encryption model, eliminating the need to share the same key by using a pair of public/private keys.</li>

  <li>Different types of storage</li>
  <li>What is a CDN? (Follow-up) How does a CDN make web sites faster (Follow-up) Why is it important who would setup the CDN?</li>
  <li>
    <p>Why you should use a CDN for a object with a zero TTL? (Answer) a 0 TTL results in a client making an If Modified Since request, hence if the content has not be modified, it will be served from the local cache. If the content has no-cache, it will be fetched everytime regardless of it being expired or not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is difference between cluster and mirroring (Answer 1.) Mirroring, described Mirroring, is the mechanism by which a single database server maintains a copy of a specific dbspace on a separate disk. This mechanism protects the data in mirrored dbspaces against disk failure because the database server automatically updates data on both disks and automatically uses the other disk if one of the dbspaces fails. (Answer 2.) Alternatively, a cluster duplicates on an entirely separate database server all the data that a database server manages, not just the specified dbspaces. Because clustering involves two separate database servers, it protects the data that these database servers manage, not just against disk failures, but against all types of database server failures, including a computer failure or the catastrophic failure of an entire site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>DAS vs NAS vs SAN</li>
  <li>Differene between OLTP and DW</li>
  <li>
    <p>How will you improve the performance of a database? (Answer) add normalization technique.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is Sharding? (Answer) Partition of a huge database into smaller databases in order to gain performance and managebility. Sharding is a method of splitting and storing a larger dataset in multiple databases. Sharding is necessary if a dataset is too large to be stored in a single database. By distributing the data among multiple machines, a cluster of database systems can store larger dataset and handle additional requests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is De-Duplication in storage? (Answer) Data deduplication is a specialized data compression technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data and reduces storage overhead. Data deduplication techniques ensure that only one unique instance of data is retained on storage media, such as disk, flash or tape. This is also one of the <strong>WAN optimization</strong> techniques</p>

    <p>What are the top 3 most important aspects of SaaS? (Answer 1.) First, location for clients. Being able to access the software with the least amount of latency is critical. (Answer 2.) Second is security, address PCI, HIPAA, SOC, etc is going to be a concern when clients who maybe competitors use the same software. (Answer 3.) Third is scalability, if you can’t handle the growth of new customers and maybe their clients you won’t have a product worth scaling and instead increasing the management overhead.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Design a hybrid solutions for an enterprise customer that needs to store files online in a private cloud with 99.95% SLA and specify which AWS component you will need to use and details about security, access control etc  (Answer) Tech questions are “easier” but I think a minimum knowledge of AWS and how to architect cloud solutions is required for this role, although I heard a few people saying that no pre knowledge of AWS is required for some roles. Anyway, if you want to work with AWS or be a good professional no matter what provider pls do your homework: signup for a AWS certification courses (a cloud guru, LinuxAcademy, Udemy, edx, LinkedIn Training etc) look at AWS SA blogs, white papers, AWS training and Reinvent on youtube, case studies and examples on LinkedIn presentation and <em>practice</em> on the console before trying to pass this interview.</p>

  <li>
    <p>How would you debug a poor-performing data project for an upset client? (Answer 1.) I inquired on what the client was trying to achieve, performed an analysis of the SQL and data schema and recommended corrective actions while explaining the anticipated results. First, you have to define “poor performing”. Then perform a full stack assessment: Are instances optimized for their respective roles in the stack? Load balancing in place? Auto-scaling in place? Throughput? Appropriate type of DB (NoSQL vs. RDB), lots of considerations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>What kind of Metrics would you monitor for the E-commerce website application front-end?</li>
  <li>Case studies for some random startup running on pre y2k technology stack and now wants to scale with AWS.</li>
  <li>
    <p>What would you do if a web application could not talk to the database? (Answer 1.) Process of elimination, See if any other apps using the database are down. Try to establish if it’s a database server issue. If not I’d move to the firewall and establish port 1521 was open on the database server. If that checked out I would start on the webserver and probably start with rebooting the webserver, since it’s down anyway. Start with the simple stuff and work my way through troubleshooting the webserver, is the webserver running, services started, error logs, etc… (Anwer 2.) I would first verify the database is up, check RDS monitoring to see if anything sticks out. Check the security group of the database to ensure that the port the web app connects to it on has the right source sg/subnets (Answer 3.) I will check if there is any firewall and check ports if they are open</p>
